# =============================================================================
# Below is the explanation of the project structure.
# =============================================================================
# The bin directory will contain any executable scripts you intend to build.

# The data folder contains additional data of your project.

# The docs directory contains the Sphinx documentation generator, Python documentation is written in restructuredText,
# a Markup language similar to Markdown and others. Run "sphinx-quickstart" inside docs folder to
# generate documentation.

# Data scientists also typically also have a fixtures directory in which to store data files.

# The src and tests directories are actually Python modules (packages) since they contain the
# __init__.py file. You'll put your code in foo and your tests in tests.

# When you finish your project, create your requirements.txt using "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in your project root.

# The setup.py script is a Python setuptools or distutils installation script and will allow you to configure your
# project for deployment. It will use the requirements.txt to specify the third party dependencies required to
# implement your project. Other developers will also use these files to create their development environments.

# Here is a tool to help you create the project template: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter.

    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.

    # The keys to this dictionary are package names, and an empty package name stands for the root package.
    # The values are directory names relative to your distribution root
    # Additionally, check here: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html.

    # first argument to find_packages(). (And such projects also need something like package_dir={"": "src"} in their
    # setup() arguments, but thatâ€™s just a normal distutils thing.)

    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data' Each (directory, files) pair in the

    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which

# Instruction for setup.py
# ======================================================================================
# Let's start with some definitions:
# Package - A folder/directory that contains __init__.py file.
# Module - A valid python file with .py extension.
# Distribution - How one package relates to other packages and modules.

# ===================Installation ======================================================
# https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives.
# setup.py is Python's answer to a multi-platform installer and is similar to Makefile.
# If youâ€™re familiar with command line installations, then make && make install translates to
# python setup.py build && python setup.py install.
# Best practice: use pip. It only offers improvements over using python setup.py install.
# Refer to:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15724093/difference-between-python-setup-py-install-and-pip-install/15731459.

# Run "pip install ." in your project root to install this
# package "sample-python-project". It will use setup.py to install this package. Run "pip show sample-python-project"
#  to verify the installation.

# ===================Distribution =======================================================
# 1. Before you begin, make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools and wheel:
# pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel. This will generate distribution archives in the dist directory.

# 2. To build a setuptools project, run this command from the same directory where setup.py is located:
# python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# 3. Before you upload the generated archives make sure youâ€™re registered on https://test.pypi.org/account/register/.
# You will also need to verify your email to be able to upload any packages.
# You should install twine to be able to upload packages:You should install twine to be able to upload packages:
# pip install --upgrade twine

# 4. Now, to upload these archives, run:
# twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

# 5. To install your newly uploaded package example_pkg, you can use pip:
# pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ sample_python_package

# 6. Follow the link below to upload a real package to the Python Package Index :
# https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#next-steps.
